# 📈 Startup-Profit-Predictor
This repository contains a machine learning application that predicts startup profits based on input features like R&D spending, marketing budget, and location. Built with Streamlit for an interactive web interface and a gradient descent-based model for predictions, this project showcases skills in data science, machine learning, and web development.
📖 Overview
The Startup Profit Predictor is a web-based application that uses a machine learning model optimized with gradient descent to estimate the profitability of startups. It leverages a preprocessed dataset (df.pkl) and a scikit-learn pipeline (pipe.pkl) for data handling and predictions. The Streamlit UI allows users to input startup details and receive instant profit predictions, making it a practical tool for business analytics.
🎯 Features

Predicts startup profits based on features like:
R&D spending
Marketing budget
Location or other business metrics


Gradient descent-based machine learning model for accurate predictions.
Interactive and responsive Streamlit UI for user input and visualization.
Preprocessing pipeline with feature scaling and encoding for robust data handling.
Modular codebase for easy maintenance and scalability.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python: Core programming language.
Streamlit: For building the interactive web interface.
Scikit-learn: For the gradient descent-based model and preprocessing pipeline.
Pandas/NumPy: For data manipulation and processing.
Pickle: For serializing the dataset (df.pkl) and pipeline (pipe.pkl).
Git: Version control with .gitignore for clean repository management.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Git

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/RachitNigam19/Startup-Profit-Predictor.git
cd Startup-Profit-Predictor


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Ensure the serialized files (df.pkl, pipe.pkl) are in the root directory.

Usage

Run the Streamlit application:streamlit run app.py


Open the provided URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501) in your browser.
Input startup details (e.g., R&D spending, marketing budget) via the Streamlit UI to get a profit prediction.

🔍 How It Works

Dataset: The df.pkl file contains a preprocessed dataset of startups with features like R&D spending, marketing budget, and location.
Preprocessing: The pipe.pkl file stores a scikit-learn pipeline that handles feature scaling, encoding, and other transformations.
Model: A machine learning model (likely linear regression or similar, optimized with gradient descent) predicts profits based on input features.
Web UI: The app.py script uses Streamlit to create an interactive interface for users to input data and view predictions.
